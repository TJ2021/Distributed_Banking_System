# Distributed Banking System
## About The Project
The Distributed Banking System is an application designed to handle transactions across multiple bank branches in a distributed environment.
Utilizing gRPC for communication, the system ensures consistency and reliability in managing deposits, withdrawals, and balance queries. 
The project leverages the concept of distributed computing to simulate the operations of a banking network, where each branch operates independently yet stays synchronized with others.
The system is built to handle simultaneous client requests and propagate updates across all branches, ensuring data integrity and consistency.
